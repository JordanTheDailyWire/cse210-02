## Hilo Game

- This Hilo game is a card game, where you try to guess the next card.
You chose between 1 to 13 and depending on the number you guess you can lose or win.
- hilo_game.py holds the main program which runs the game. I applied abstraction to my program by dividing up the card functions and data to various files like hilo.py, hilo_common.py, and hilo_game.py. The hilo.py generates a number between 1 and 13. The hilo_common.py shares the game data, variables, and information. hilo_game.py executes the logic from hilo_common.py and hilo.py to run the hilo game.
